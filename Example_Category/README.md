# **Example Category**

## **📌 Overview**
The **Example Category** contains various Python scripts designed to serve as **modular, reusable templates** for automation, data processing, and file management tasks. Each program follows a **structured format**, ensuring easy integration, modification, and scalability.

Each program includes:
- **A Python boilerplate template** for structured and reusable scripts.
- **High-level & structured pseudocode** (`T1_HighLevel_PC.md` & `T2_Structured_PC.md`).
- **Clear usage instructions** in its README.
- **Command-line arguments (optional)** for customization.

## **📂 Programs Included**

### **1️⃣ Boilerplate Demo**
📌 **A fully structured Python template for writing modular and maintainable scripts.**  
- Provides **a well-defined structure** for new projects.  
- Uses **optional command-line arguments** via `argparse`.  
- Includes **execution timing** to track performance.  
- Contains **example functions** that can be replaced with custom logic.  
- Ensures **scalability** by maintaining clean separation of concerns.  

📍 **Usage:**
```bash
python example-program.py
```
📍 **With optional directory scanning:**
```bash
python example-program.py /path/to/directory
```
📍 **To enable verbose output:**
```bash
python example-program.py --verbose
```

---

## **📜 Pseudocode Documentation**
Each program includes **two pseudocode files** to describe its logic clearly:

✅ **T1 High-Level Pseudocode (`T1_HighLevel_PC.md`)** → Broad overview of the program’s functionality.  
✅ **T2 Structured Pseudocode (`T2_Structured_PC.md`)** → Detailed step-by-step logic aligning with the Python implementation.
